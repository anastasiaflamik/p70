If you have not already signed up through Healthy Davis Together with the DJUSD agency, we encourage you to do so before we begin Hybrid In-person Learning on April 12. Students and staff who are currently registered for testing through Healthy Davis Together can transfer their registration to DJUSD and receive a gift card for their time. Directions to sign-up, as well as each sites’ testing times, can be found on our website. Staff and students may visit any DJUSD site to get tested - it does not have to be the school at which you work/attend.

We would like all staff and students signed up under DJUSD before we return to campus on April 12. Students and staff can walk in to get tested at any of our school sites or community testing centers without an appointment. Beginning April 12, school sites will have the following COVID-19 testing schedule:
